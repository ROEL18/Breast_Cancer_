Breast Cancer Prediction Using SVM
Overview
This project aims to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The SVM model will classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features extracted from breast cancer cell images.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. It contains 30 features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
